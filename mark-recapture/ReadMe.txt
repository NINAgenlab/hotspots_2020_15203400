/* six input files used for closed population models in Program Mark */
/* Trua Arter project, 15 March 2021 */

All files are saved as ASCII files and can be opened in Notepad.
The filename extension .inp indicates "input" and requires this extension for input to Program Mark.
All models were fit in Program Mark with Closed Captures | Huggin's p and c with Random Effects.
Numbers of occasions, attributed groups and individual covariates specified in the header for each file.
Input files set up for four sets of analyses

1.  Fungi isolated from dead wood samples (2 files)
woodyfungiCovarThreePhyla.inp = encounter histories for soil fungi isolated from dead wood and grouped by phyla
woodyfungi_FunctionalGroups.inp = encounter histories for soil fungi isolated from dead wood and the subset of fungi that could be grouped by functional group

2.  Fungi isolated from soil samples (2 files)
soilfungiSeminatural.inp = encounter histories for soil fungi isolated from soil samples in the seminatural habitat and grouped by phyla
soilfungiForest.inp = encounter histories for soil fungi isolated from soil samples in the forest habitat and grouped by phyla

3.  Plants surveyed with ANO methods and isolated from soil samples (1 file)
plantsByHabitat.inp = summary of encounter histories for plants detected with ANO surveys or with four methods of soil sampling

4.  Earthworms identified from environmental DNA isolated from soil samples (1 file)
earthwormsByHabitat.inp = summary of encounter histories for earthworms detected with four methods of soil sampling
